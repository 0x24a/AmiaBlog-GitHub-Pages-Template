# AmiaBlog-GitHub-Pages-Template
Deploy your AmiaBlog instance with GitHub Pages and Github Workflow.

# MUST READ
The site won't work if it's not deployed at the root of the domain. So auto-allocated Github Page domains(like https://0x24a.github.io/AmiaBlog-GitHub-Pages-Template/), will not work.

# Quick Start
Set up the source of Github Pages as "Github Actions", and allocate a custom domain to it or make the repo the same name as your username.  
Read [AmiaBlog Docs - Configuration](https://github.com/0x24a/AmiaBlog/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) to modify config.json to fulfill your needs.  
Write your posts, refer to [AmiaBlog Docs - Writing Posts](https://github.com/0x24a/AmiaBlog/blob/main/docs/writing-posts.md).  
Everytime you push to the main branch, the site will be automatically built and deployed.
